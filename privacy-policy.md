We do not process sensitive information.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information. 

1.2. Information automatically collected
When you visit our website, we store device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser, and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, and information about how and when you use our services, and other technical information. 

We process this usage data to facilitate your access to our services and to assure its comfortable usage (e.g., to adjust our services to the device you are using), improve the quality of the services, develop new ones, and recognize and stop any misuse. 

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. Cookies are small data files transferred onto computers or devices by sites for record-keeping purposes and to enhance functionality on our site. Cookies are stored on your individual device, and you have full control over their use. You may deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing your web browser settings. Our Cookie Notice sets out specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies.

The legal basis for this processing is your consent and our legitimate interests, as monitoring and improving our website and services. 

2. When and with whom do we share your personal information?
We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers, such as analytical services, payment processors, CRM services, and others. These service providers may have access to personal information as needed to perform their functions. Third parties with whom we share your data currently include but are not limited to Google, HelpCrunch, MailJet, and Facebook. 

These service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection and security standards. We only share information with them that is required for the services offered.

3. How long do we keep your information?
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). 

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information or if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

4. How do we keep your information safe?
We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

5. Do we collect information from minors?
